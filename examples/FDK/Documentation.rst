The same reconstruction can be performed using the original 2D Shepp-Logan phantom.
RTK can perform 2D reconstructions through images wide of 1 pixel in the y direction.
The following script performs the same reconstruction as above in a 2D environment and uses the `2D Shepp-Logan`_ phantom as input.
